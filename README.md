# Karatsuba Multiplication
## Description
This program uses the recursive Karatsuba multplication algorithm to compute the product of two numbers. These numbers can be huge due to the use of the BigInteger class. 

The program repeatedly prompts the user to enter two numbers, then prints the product to the console. 
If the user enters -1 as one of the numbers, the program terminates.
