# Karatsuba Multiplication
## Description
This program uses the recursive Karatsuba multiplication algorithm to compute the product of two numbers. These numbers can be huge due to the use of the BigInteger class. 

The program repeatedly prompts the user to enter two numbers, then prints the product to the console. 
If the user enters -1 as one of the numbers, the program terminates.

## Command Line Instructions for Karatsuba Multiplication

`cd src/`

Compile:  
`javac Karatsuba.java`

Run:  
`java Karatsuba`




# Merge Sort
## Description
This program uses the recursive merge sort algorithm to sort an array of ints.

The program doesn't prompt the user to enter any values, rather just shows
a short demonstration of sorting three different int arrays.

## Command Line Instructions for Merge Sort

`cd src`

Compile:  
`javac Mergesort.java`  

Run:  
`java Mergesort`
